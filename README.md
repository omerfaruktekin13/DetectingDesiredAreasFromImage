## Description
In this project, it has shown how to detect a patient's kidneys from a medical picture by using MATLAB Image Processing functions. The algorithm starts by applying a few filters to the image and clarifying the desired regions. The appropriate shape is drawn interactively on the MATLAB Plot for the cleared area. The drawn figure is extracted as a binary mask and transferred to the original photo.

## Tools and Languages
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Matlab_Logo.png" alt="matlab" width="40" height="40"/> </a>
<p> * MATLAB 2023a </p>
<p> * Image Processing Toolbox </p>

## Installation
> 1. Download the Detech.m
> 2. Open it with MATLAB and be sure that Image Processing Toolbox is already installed.
> 3. You can implement your own pictures and change the filter rates in the code to create more clear detections.
